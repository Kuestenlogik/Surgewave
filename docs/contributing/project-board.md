# Surgewave Project Board

The roadmap, in-flight work, and bug triage all live on the [Surgewave Project board](https://github.com/orgs/Kuestenlogik/projects/4). This page explains the fields and views — it doesn't replace `ROADMAP.md`, which still carries the narrative description of each track.

## Fields

| Field | Values | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | `Backlog` · `Next up` · `In progress` · `In review` · `Done` | Kanban swim-lane |
| **Milestone** *(built-in)* | `v1.x` · `v2.0` · *(unset)* | Version-targeting — the same Milestone the GitHub issue carries. Unset = backlog (rendered as "Later" in `ROADMAP.md`); no dedicated "Later" milestone, since it would be redundant with the unset state. |
| **Area** | `workbench` · `cli` · `security` · `mcp` · `plugin-sdk` · `mock` · `docs` · `site` · `bootcamp` · `multi` | Component filter |
| **Track** | `auth` · `protocols` · `marketing-ia` · `observability` · `security-tiers` · `bootcamp-content` · `none` | Multi-phase initiatives that span releases |
| **Effort** | `XS` · `S` · `M` · `L` · `XL` | T-shirt estimate |
| **Priority** | `P0` · `P1` · `P2` · `P3` | Triage |
| **Kind** | `feature` · `bug` · `debt` · `docs` · `rfc` | What it is |

## Recommended views

The board ships with the default *All items* view. The four views below mirror how Akka.NET's [v1.6 project](https://github.com/orgs/akkadotnet/projects/11/views/1) is structured — they need ~30 seconds each to configure in the UI (clone the default view, change layout + grouping):

### 🗺 Roadmap

- **Layout**: Roadmap
- **Group by**: `Milestone`
- **Filter**: `Status` ≠ `Done`
- **Use for**: "What is targeted for v1.6?" — the public-facing release plan

### 📋 Board

- **Layout**: Board
- **Group by**: `Status`
- **Filter**: `Milestone` = current (v1.5)
- **Use for**: Operational kanban — what's currently moving

### 🧩 By Area

- **Layout**: Board
- **Group by**: `Area`
- **Filter**: `Status` ≠ `Done`
- **Use for**: Drill-down per component ("show me everything `security`")

### 🐛 Bugs

- **Layout**: Table
- **Filter**: `Kind` = `bug`
- **Sort by**: `Priority` ↑ then `Status` ↑
- **Use for**: Triage backlog, regardless of milestone

## Conventions

- **One field per concept**: `Milestone` is the *when*, `Track` is the *grouped initiative across releases*, `Area` is the *component*. They overlap deliberately — Milestone is enforced (the bar for shipping), Track is editorial (Auth Phase A / B / C).
- **Labels duplicate fields on purpose**: GitHub issue search needs labels (`is:open label:area:security`). Project filters need fields. The two are kept in sync so an issue is findable from either side.
- **`roadmap` label** flags items that are tracked on the board. Throwaway bug reports don't need it.
- **`community-vote` label** marks feature requests where reactions on the issue are read as priority signal. Don't comment "+1" — react with 👍.
- **PRs close issues via `Closes #N`** so Status flips to `Done` automatically and the item drops off the active views.

## Maintenance

- New issue created via *Convert from Markdown* (in the issue editor) or *Create issue* — the board adds it as `Backlog` by default.
- Status transitions: `Backlog` → `Next up` → `In progress` → `In review` → `Done`. The last two are driven by PR state where possible.
- Milestones are managed in [Settings → Issues → Milestones](https://github.com/Kuestenlogik/Surgewave/milestones). When a milestone closes, its issues move out of the `Roadmap` view automatically.

### Milestone title = release theme

Every milestone's **title** carries the release headline directly: `vX.Y[.Z] — <theme>`. The theme is the same one that lands on the GitHub Release once the milestone tags, and it shows in the Project board's Roadmap view as the group heading (since Projects v2 reads the milestone title verbatim).

Format examples that work well:
- `v1.7 — new protocol plugins`
- `v1.8 — AI workbench`
- `v1.9 — AI for security`
- `v1.10 — gRPC Connect`

**One concept per release.** Themes are 2-5 words, concrete enough that a reader knows what the cycle is about (`gRPC Connect` beats `protocol expansion`). Avoid `+`-joined dual themes — if a cycle is gathering two big buckets, split them into two milestones instead of bundling. Splitting forces a decision about which bucket is the actual focus; bundling defers it.

**Why pre-commit a theme at planning time:** the headline defines what the cycle is *about* — what we'd be embarrassed to ship without. It anchors the milestone discussion ("does this issue serve the theme?"), avoids the retrospective scramble of summarising whatever happened to land, and gives the team a one-line elevator pitch through the cycle. Mid-cycle pivots are fine — rename the milestone (GitHub keeps the audit trail).

**Mechanical consequences:**
- `release.yml` parses the matching milestone's title when creating the GitHub Release and uses the `<theme>` tail as `vX.Y.Z — <theme>`. No hand-editing of the release title required.
- `scripts/generate-roadmap.mjs` renders the full title as the section heading in `ROADMAP.md` so the offline view matches the Project board.
- The milestone description stays free-form for slip context, stakeholder hints, &c. — no machinery parses it.
- If the milestone title is bare (`v2.0` with no ` — <theme>` tail), the release falls back to a bare `vX.Y.Z` title and the roadmap section shows no theme — so missing themes are visible by their absence rather than crashing the pipeline.

**CLI ergonomics caveat:** `gh issue list --milestone v2.0` no longer matches when the milestone is renamed to `v2.0 — <theme>` — `gh` matches the full title verbatim. Either use the full title, or look up by milestone number (`--milestone <N>`).

## Automation

The roadmap is wired to maintain itself once an issue lands with `label:roadmap`:

| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| New issue with `roadmap` label | `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml` attaches it to the Project (Status defaults to `Backlog`) |
| Issue closed | `roadmap-sync.yml` regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from the Project + commits |
| Issue title / label / milestone change | same — `roadmap-sync.yml` re-renders |
| PR merged that uses `Closes #N` | Status flips to `Done` via Project workflow (UI-side, see below) |
| Daily 05:23 UTC | Safety-net `roadmap-sync.yml` cron |

### One-time setup (single PAT, org-secret)

`add-to-project.yml` and `Surgewave.Bootcamp/notify-surgewave.yml` share **one** organization secret `BOWIRE_DISPATCH_TOKEN`. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't write to org-level Projects nor dispatch into sibling repos, so a PAT is required either way — but only one.

1. Create a fine-grained PAT — Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained.
   - Resource owner: `Kuestenlogik`
   - Repository access: `Kuestenlogik/Surgewave` + all sibling Surgewave.* repos (Bootcamp, Templates, VulnDb, Protocol.*, Sdk.*)
   - **Repository permissions**: `Contents: R/W`, `Issues: Read`, `Pull requests: Read`
   - **Organization permissions**: `Projects: Read and write`
2. Save as organization secret **`BOWIRE_DISPATCH_TOKEN`** in `Kuestenlogik` org settings → Secrets → Actions → New organization secret. Repository access: "Selected repositories" → tick every Surgewave.* repo.
3. Both workflows pick it up automatically; nothing per-repo to configure.

### Project-side workflows (UI-only)

Configure once in the Project UI — these aren't exposed via API yet, so they live alongside the GitHub Action workflow files.

1. Open https://github.com/orgs/Kuestenlogik/projects/4 → **⚙ Settings** → **Workflows**
2. **Item closed** → enable → Set status to `Done`.
3. **Pull request merged** → enable → Set status to `Done`.
4. **Auto-add to project** → leave **disabled** for `Kuestenlogik/Surgewave` (the GitHub Action above handles that with the label filter). For sibling Surgewave.* repos that don't carry the workflow file, enable Auto-add with filter `repo:Kuestenlogik/<RepoName> label:roadmap is:issue,pr`.

Sibling-repo wiring options (Project-side auto-add vs Action-side label-filter vs back-fill) are picked per-repo; the Project-side default works for most cases.

## Migration from `ROADMAP.md`

The pilot batch lives on the board now (6 items from *In progress* + *Next up*). `ROADMAP.md` is unchanged for the moment. Once the board's daily feel is validated, the plan is:

1. Migrate the rest of `ROADMAP.md` to issues, one per `###` heading.
2. Trim `ROADMAP.md` to a ~30-line index that points at the board and the **In progress** + **Next up** highlights, regenerated periodically from the board.
3. The marketing site's `roadmap.html` pulls from the Project's GraphQL API (cached as `site/_data/roadmap.yml` via a GitHub Action) so visitors see live data without the page making a network call.

Rollback plan: closing the issues and deleting the project + milestones restores the previous "ROADMAP.md is the only source" state. The labels stay — they're useful regardless.
